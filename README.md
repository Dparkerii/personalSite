# Front end for a personal site
This is the front end to a website that can be used to display a resume and current activity through a blog.  Currently developing the administrative page to be able to easily perform CRUD operations.  

This site is built using:
* Typescript
* React
* React-router
* Semantic-ui-react
* Helmet

To use:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
This will start just the front end, and has no database connected.  For that navigate to [backend](https://github.com/Dparkerii/personalSiteBackend)
