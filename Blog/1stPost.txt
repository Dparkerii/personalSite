    Overview:
        At this time I am a recent graduate from university in my first job as a front end developer.
    I built this site to practice skills I use on my job and to showcase various projects I do in my free time.
    For this site I started by choosing what overall package, aka starter kit, I would use, knowing javascript has an insane amount of libraries.
    Overall I chose to use a MERN stack, mainly as practice again for job.  This is a static site so using react may be overkill.

    Structure:
        app --|
            front--|
                src--|
                    assets--|
                    components--|
                    pages--|
                    index.tsx
                    registerServiceWorker.ts
                public--/
                node_modules--/
                package.json
                tsconfig.json
                tsconfig.test.json
                tslint.json
            back--|
    Front:
        I started with the front end, that was done using create-react-app <app name> --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
        Start with what you want the site to do, this site just reads data from a database then renders it in a pretty way.
        Nothing special, just a CRUD app.
    Back:
        Whole different beast
        get postman
        once postman works your api is fine, accessing it is wrong
            postman is not a browser and can cause differences
    Connecting:
        express returns an async response, .then(convert to json).then(return stuff) frontend
    Maintenance:
        admin page to do CRUD for various pages
